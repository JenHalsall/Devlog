The Tree Ottawa app is in its final stages, with most of the content inputted. Now, I'm trying to reconcile the final changes:
+ Accessibility (locations, vision, tech literacy and affluence)
+ Politics and Theory:
* Gender imbalance
* Moving away from black and white narratives, need more nuance with local acceptance and resistance
* Lack of diverse representation (all my D&D guys are white)
+ Intagrating layered landscapes
* More focus on reading lanscapes, evolution of trees and canopy
* Focus on who and why of landscape use
* Landscape as an evolution
+ Integrating more textual sources (Greber plan and photos, but what about resistance?)
+ Who is real? 
+ Copyright, media usage (what is gurella?)
++ NCC DIgiLab photos
++ Clipart
