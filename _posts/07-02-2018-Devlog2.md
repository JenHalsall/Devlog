Projection is the name of the game, I'm thinking.
Breathing life into ruins with light projection and recreating the past. Progress this week:
+ Teamed up with Denise
+ Selected the Bytown Museum and accompanying ruins as the most likely prospective site
+ Plan to test the projector to see how it works against a backdrop of stone and leaves; must also find a power source
+ Prepare two projections: one on the Bytown Museum (existing building) and one on the ruins adjacent. Parallel narraitves.

The ruins are a relatively high-traffic site, with the Bytown Museum providing additional foot traffic in the off season.
