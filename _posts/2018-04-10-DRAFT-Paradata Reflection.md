# The Importance of Documentation: Why this page exists
The creation of the Tree Ottawa game has reinforced many assertions that have come up in relevant digital humanities scholarship. However, the importance of documentation is by far the most critical. It allows for the technical knowledge and critical thought wrapped up in the actual creation of the "thing," whatever it may be, to exist beyond its immediate end product. To me, documentation is akin to a manual of bike repair. With it, you view the product in a new light, and ideally you are able to go back and recreate (to an extent) the original outcome. Or, even better, you can improve it. 

As Jenny Kidd, a DH scholar and author of "Digital storytelling and the performance of memory," asserts, “carrying memory for an assumed infinitum is a task the digital media ably take on." However, she notes this task is not without its challenges. She is quick to point out that things die in the digital much as they do in real life. File formats become obsolete, as do storage methods. Web hosting platforms go under, and may take your data with them. Nonetheless, new media have an “integral role to play in what is remembered, the form in which it is stored, and, later, how it will be retrieved.”[1]
