So this is a Jeckyll post. I'm curious about Hyde. That, and the apparent 300+ contributers on this little fork of mine, which is publicly available and itches at my desire for privacy. Were this not for a course, I would never have used my real name. Of course, as it turns out, writing under an alias was permitted all along, but here we are.

I was concerned about privacy but apparently I can't get this page up and running, so that solves that (I hope).
